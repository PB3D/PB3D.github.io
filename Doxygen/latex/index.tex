This page contains the technical documentation of the {\bfseries{PB3D}} project. A pdf version can be downloaded \href{https://pb3d.github.io/PB3D_manual.pdf}{\texttt{here}}.

It contains a general overview of the code in \doxysectlink{page_overview}{General code structure}{0}, which is much more detailed than what can be found in \DoxyCite{weyens2017pb3d}{number}{1}.

To get started, for installation instructions, please see \doxysectlink{page_installation}{Installation}{0} instructions.

Also, in \doxysectlink{page_tutorial}{Tutorial}{0}, you can find a hands-\/on tutorial on running the code.

Furthermore, in \doxysectlink{page_inputs}{Input variables}{0}, the multitude of input variables is discussed.

Additionally, in \doxysectlink{page_outputs}{Code outputs}{0}, the same is done for the output that can be produced, including the output by POST.

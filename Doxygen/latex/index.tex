This page contains the technical documentation of the {\bfseries P\+B3D} project. A pdf version can be downloaded \href{https://pb3d.github.io/PB3D_manual.pdf}{\tt here}.

It contains a general overview of the code in \hyperlink{page_overview}{General code structure}, which is much more detailed than what can be found in \cite{Weyens2017PB3D}.

To get started, for installation instructions, please see \hyperlink{page_installation}{Installation} instructions.

Also, in \hyperlink{page_tutorial}{Tutorial}, you can find a hands-\/on tutorial on running the code.

Furthermore, in \hyperlink{page_inputs}{Input variables}, the multitude of input variables is discussed.

Additionally, in \hyperlink{page_outputs}{Code outputs}, the same is done for the output that can be produced, including the output by P\+O\+ST.

For a list of frequently asked questions and frequently encountered problems, consult the \hyperlink{page_faq}{Frequently Asked Questions}.

  
Finally, the various modules of which the program consists can be explored in detail in the appendices pages, as well as the procedures and the variables.

abstract = {Hamiltonian and action principle formulations of the basic equations of plasma physics are reviewed. Various types of Lagrangian and Poisson bracket formulations for kinetic and fluid theories are discussed, and it is described how such formulations can be used to derive and approximate physical models. Additional uses are also described. Two applications are treated in greater detail: an algorithm based on Dirac brackets for the calculation of V-states of contour dynamics and the calculation of fluctuation spectra of Vlasov theory and shear flow dynamics by methods of statistical mechanics. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n{\&}copy;2005 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {The secant method is a very effective numerical procedure used for solving nonlinear equations of the form f(x) = 0. It is derived via a linear interpolation procedure and employs only values of f(x) at the approximations to the root of f(x) = 0, hence it computes f(x) only once per iteration. In this note, we generalize it by replacing the relevant linear interpolant by a suitable (k + 1)point polynomial of interpolation, where k is an integer at least 2. Just as the secant method, this generalization too enjoys the property that it computes f(x) only once per iteration. We provide its error in closed form and analyze its order of convergence. We show that this order of convergence is greater than that of the secant method, and it increases as k increases. We also confirm the theory via an illustrative example.},

In the nonlinear phase, the modes grow explosively, forming a number of extended filaments which propagate rapidly from the outer closed flux region into the open flux region toward the outboard wall. Similarities to nonlinear ballooning theory as well as additional complexities are observed. Comparison to observations reveals a number of similarities.

abstract = {? 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.Using the recently developed multiregion, relaxed MHD (MRxMHD) theory, which bridges the gap between Taylor's relaxation theory and ideal MHD, we provide a thorough analytical and numerical proof of the formation of singular currents at rational surfaces in non-axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibria. These include the force-free singular current density represented by a Dirac ?-function, which presumably prevents the formation of islands, and the Pfirsch-Schl?ter 1/x singular current, which arises as a result of finite pressure gradient. An analytical model based on linearized MRxMHD is derived that can accurately (1) describe the formation of magnetic islands at resonant rational surfaces, (2) retrieve the ideal MHD limit where magnetic islands are shielded, and (3) compute the subsequent formation of singular currents. The analytical results are benchmarked against numerical simulations carried out with a fully nonlinear implementation of MRxMHD.},

@article{Rueckerta,
abstract = {This chapter introduces a number of methods for obtaining spline approximations to given functions, or more precisely, to data obtained by sampling a function. In Section 5.1, we focus on local methods where the approximation at a point x only depends on data values near x. Connecting neighbouring data points with straight lines is one such method where the value of the approximation at a point only depends on the two nearest data points. In order to get smoother approximations, we must use splines of higher degree. With cubic polynomials we can prescribe, or interpolate, position and first derivatives at two points. Therefore, given a set of points with associated function values and first derivatives, we can determine a sequence of cubic polynomials that interpolate the data, joined together with continuous first derivatives. This is the cubic Hermite interpolant of Section 5.1.2. In Section 5.2 we study global cubic approximation methods where we have to solve a system of equations involving all the data points in order to obtain the approximation. Like the local methods in Section 5.1, these methods interpolate the data, which now only are positions. The gain in turning to global methods is that the approximation may have more continuous derivatives and still be as accurate as the local methods. The cubic spline interpolant with so called natural end conditions solves an interesting extremal problem. Among all functions with a continuous second derivative that interpol-ate a set of data, the natural cubic spline interpolant is the one whose integral of the square of the second derivative is the smallest. This is the foundation for various interpretations of splines, and is all discussed in Section 5.2. Two approximation methods for splines of arbitrary degree are described in Section 5.3. The first method is spline interpolation with B-splines defined on some rather arbitrary knot vector. The disadvantage of using interpolation methods is that the approximations have a tendency to oscillate. If we reduce the dimension of the approximating spline space, and instead minimize the error at the data points this problem can be greatly reduced. Such least squares methods are studied in Section 5.3.2. We end the chapter by a discussing a very simple approximation method, the Variation Diminishing Spline Approximation. This approximation scheme has the desirable ability to transfer the sign of some of the derivatives of a function to the approximation. This is 103 104 CHAPTER 5. SPLINE APPROXIMATION OF FUNCTIONS AND DATA important since many important characteristics of the shape of a function is closely related to the sign of the derivatives. 5.1 Local Approximation Methods When we construct an approximation to data, it is usually an advantage if the approx-imation at a point x only depends on the data near x. If this is the case, changing the data in some small area will only affect the approximation in the same area. The variation diminishing approximation method and in particular piecewise linear interpolation has this property, it is a local method. In this section we consider another local approximation method. 5.1.1 Piecewise linear interpolation},
annote = {Actual application of splines to interpolation, possibly with smoothing.

It is not yet completely for interpolation how the requirement that the spline passes through the points exactly differs from the splines from the first chapters, where the points were only passed through for nodes with appropriate multiplicities. Here, they are all 1, but it looks like other constraints are applied in setting up the matrix (5.19), with knowledge of where the B-spline values are one and where they are zero.},

Growth rates calculated by M 3 D- C 1 in the ideal limit are found to agree with those calculated by ideal magnetohydrodynamics codes. The effects of nonuniform density and resistivity profiles are explored, as well as the sensitivity of growth rates to the position of the ideal vacuum-plasma interface. Growth rates of the diverted equilibrium are found to be particularly sensitive to moving this interface inward from the separatrix, but less sensitive to extending the plasma region beyond the separatrix. The resistivity profile within the plasma is found not to affect growth rates significantly; however, growth rates may be greatly reduced by treating the outer region as a resistive plasma instead of an ideal vacuum. Indeed, it is found that for typical scrape-off layer (SOL) temperatures, the resistive SOL model behaves more like an ideal plasma than a vacuum.},

abstract = {The overall efficiency of the recently developed ideal ballooning code COBRA is greatly improved by using a magnetic equilibrium description based on the same magnetic coordinates used to compute it by the VMEC 3D equilibrium code. VMEC determines this set of coordinates by requiring a spectrally condensed Fourier representation of the solution, releasing in the process the constraint of straight-field-line coordinates. This increases the analytic complexity of the ideal ballooning stability problem, since another equation must be now solved to follow the magnetic field line when integrating the ideal ballooning equation. However, from a numerical point of view, the much smaller number of Fourier harmonics needed together with the elimination of an equilibrium mapping to straight-line coordinates saves an enormous amount of time. This enhancement might prove to be essential within the compact stellarator optimization environment in which the speed and accuracy of this code can play an important role.},

abstract = {In the investigation of stability of a plasma confined by magnetic fields some of the most important modes of oscillation are those with long wavelength parallel to the magnetic field and short wavelength perpendicular to it. However, these characteristics conflict with the requirement of periodicity in a toroidal magnetic field with shear. This conflict can be resolved by transforming the calculation to one in an infinite domain without periodicity constraints. This transformation is the starting point for a full investigation of the magnetohydrodynamic stability of an axisymmetric plasma at large toroidal wave number {\$}n{\$}. (Small values of {\$}n{\$} can be studied by direct numerical computation but this fails when {\$}n{\$} is large.) For {\$}n\backslashgg {\$} 1 there are two distinct length scales in the problem and a systematic approximation is developed around an eikonal representation, formally as an expansion in {\$}1/n{\$}. In lowest order the oscillations of each magnetic surface are decoupled and a local eigenvalue is obtained. However, the mode structure is not fully determined in this lowest order. In higher orders a second eigenvalue equation is obtained which completes the determination of the structure of the mode and relates the local eigenvalue of the lower order theory to the true eigenvalue for the problem. This higher order theory shows that unstable modes are localized in the vicinity of the surface with the smallest local eigenvalue, that the true eigenvalue is close to the lowest local eigenvalue and that the most unstable high {\$}n{\$} modes occur for {\$}n\backslashrightarrow {\$} {\$}\backslashinfty {\$}. Hence the local theory, which involves no more than the solution of an ordinary differential equation, is normally adequate for the determination of stability of any axisymmetric plasma to high mode number oscillations.},

abstract = {The STARWALL/CAS3D/OPTIM code package is a powerful tool to study the linear MHD stability of 3D, ideal equilibria in the presence of multiply-connected ideal and/or resistive conducting structures, and their feedback stabilization by external currents. Robust feedback stabilization of resistive wall modes can be modelled with the OPTIM code. Resistive MHD studies are possible combining STARWALL with the linear, resistive 2D CASTOR code as well as nonlinear MHD simulations combining STARWALL with the JOREK code. In the present paper, a detailed description of the STARWALL code is given and some of its applications are presented to demonstrate the methods used. Conducting structures are treated in the thin wall approximation and depending on their complexity they are discretized by a spectral method or by triangular finite elements. As an example, a configuration is considered consisting of an ideal plasma surrounded by a vacuum domain containing a resistive wall and bounded by an external wall. Ideal linear MHD modes and resistive wall modes in the presence of multiply-connected walls are studied. In order to treat the vertical mode self-consistently the STARWALL code has been completed by adding the so-called Luest-Martensen term generated by a constant normal displacement of the plasma. The appendix contains the computation of the 2D Fourier transform of singular inductance integrals, and the derivation of an asymptotic expansion for large Fourier harmonics.},

The proposed technique is highly effective in cases where a large number of harmonics is required. The new feature concerns the efficient and reliable computation of the axisymmetric fundamental solutions. The methodology is applicable to any type of boundary elements, either continuous or discontinuous, for both direct and indirect BEM formulations. Numerical results are presented for constant boundary elements for typical potential and elasticity problems. Although the method is presented for static problems, it is general and can be applied to a wider class of boundary value axisymmetric problems, such as acoustics and elastodynamics in the frequency or the time domain.},

A strong stabilizing effect has been observed for the ideal and the resistive peeling mode for instabilities driven by the edge current gradient. Both approaches are in good agreement. A new resistive instability remains unstable and is not significantly affected by the separatrix. This mode is a combination of a kink and a tearing type mode and could be called a peeling–tearing mode.},

@article{Sauter2013,
abstract = {Dealing with electromagnetic fields, in particular current and related magnetic fields, yields "natural" physical vector relations in 3-D. However, when it comes to choosing local coordinate systems, the "usual" right-handed systems are not necessarily the best choices, which means that there are several options being chosen. In the magnetic fusion community such a difficulty exists for the choices of the cylindrical and of the toroidal coordinate systems. In addition many codes depend on knowledge of an equilibrium. In particular, the Grad-Shafranov axisymmetric equilibrium solution for tokamak plasmas, ??, does not depend on the sign of the plasma current I p nor that of the magnetic field B 0. This often results in ill-defined conventions. Moreover the sign, amplitude and offset of ?? are of less importance, since the free sources in the equation depend on the normalized radial coordinate. The signs of the free sources, dpd?? and dF 2d?? (p being the pressure, ?? the poloidal magnetic flux and F=RB ??), must be consistent to generate the current density profile. For example, RF and CD calculations (Radio Frequency heating and Current Drive) require an exact sign convention in order to calculate a co- or counter-CD component. It is shown that there are over 16 different coordinate conventions. This paper proposes a unique identifier, the COCOS convention, to distinguish between the 16 most-commonly used options. Given the present worldwide efforts towards code integration, the proposed new index COCOS defining uniquely the COordinate COnventionS required as input by a given code or module is particularly useful. As codes use different conventions, it is useful to allow different sign conventions for equilibrium code input and output, equilibrium being at the core of any calculations in magnetic fusion. Additionally, given two different COCOS conventions, it becomes simple to transform between them. The relevant transformations are described in detail. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Solutions to a model 2D eigenmode equation describing micro-instabilities in tokamak plasmas are presented that demonstrate a sensitivity of the mode structure and stability to plasma profiles. In narrow regions of parameter space, with special plasma profiles, a maximally unstable mode is found that balloons on the outboard side of the tokamak. This corresponds to the conventional picture of a ballooning mode. However, for most profiles, this mode cannot exist, and instead, a more stable mode is found that balloons closer to the top or bottom of the plasma. Good quantitative agreement with a 1D ballooning analysis is found, provided the constraints associated with higher order profile effects, often neglected, are taken into account. A sudden transition from this general mode to the more unstable ballooning mode can occur for a critical flow shear, providing a candidate model for why some experiments observe small plasma eruptions (Edge Localised Modes, or ELMs) in place of large Type I ELMs.},

It was found that the pedestal pressure was increased with a decrease in fast ion loss power. On the other hand, the variation in toroidal rotation did not affect strongly the pedestal pressure, although the loss of fast ions due to existing large toroidal field ripple forced the toroidal rotation basically to the counter direction in JT-60U. Due to the enhanced counter toroidal rotation induced by the loss of fast ions, similar Vtor profiles were obtained for discharges with different toroidal momentum source and loss of fast ions. When the loss of fast ions became smaller, pedestal density was raised remarkably while there was no significant difference in the temperature profiles. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An equilibrium of this type with a spherical plasma boundary is investigated, and characteristic quantities are computed. Perturbation of the pressure and current profiles leads to deformation of the spherical plasma boundary, thus indicating the existence of a large class of equilibria with a nonspherical boundary.

Energy confinement time as predicted by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ITER-H98(y,2) scaling at densities near or in excess of 85{\%} of the Greenwald density limit scaling has been obtained by (i) strong plasma shaping (triangularity 0.35{\textless}$\delta${\textless}0.5), or (ii) impurity seeding, or (iii) high-field side pellet injection. Slow peaking of central density without confinement degradation is observed. Loss of sawteeth and core impurity accumulation is prevented by central ion cyclotron resonance heating. In high triangularity and impurity seeded plasmas, reduction of average power loss associated with type I edge localized modes (ELMs) is found which is attributed to the occurrence of additional losses in between ELMs. Broad band magnetic fluctuations are seen which are reminiscent of regimes with small ELMs in other tokamaks. Plasma configurations have been varied to find best combinations of edge pedestal parameters and small ELM losses.},

abstract = {In-vessel, non-axisymmetric, control coils have proven to be an important option for mitigating and suppressing edge-localized modes (ELMs) in high performance operating regimes on a growing number of tokamaks. Additionally, an in-vessel non-axisymmetric ELM control coil is being considered in the ITER baseline design. In preparing for the initial operation of this coil set, a comprehensive study was carried out to characterize the linear superposition of the 3D vacuum magnetic field, produced by the ELM coil, on a series of equilibria representing nine standard ITER operating scenarios. Here, the spatial phase angle of toroidally distributed currents, specified with a cosine waveform, in the upper and lower rows of the ITER ELM coil (IEC) set is varied in 2° steps while holding the current in the equatorial row of coils constant. The peak current in each of the three toroidal rows of window-frame coils making up the IEC is scanned between 5 kAt and 90 kAt in 5 kAt steps and the width of the edge region covered by overlapping vacuum field magnetic islands is calculated. This width is compared to a vacuum field ELM suppression correlation criterion found in DIII-D. A minimum coil current satisfying the DIII-D criterion, along with an associated set of phase angles, is identified for each ITER operating scenario. These currents range from 20 kAt to 75 kAt depending on the operating scenario being used and the toroidal mode number (n) of the cosine waveform. Comparisons between the scaling of the divertor footprint area in cases with n = 3 perturbation fields versus those with n = 4 show significant advantages when using n = 3. In addition, it is found that the DIII-D correlation criterion can be satisfied in the event that various combinations of individual IEC window-frame coils need to be turned off due to malfunctioning components located inside the vacuum vessel. Details of these results for both the full set of 27 window-frame coils and various reduced sets, using either n = 3 and n = 4 perturbation fields, are discussed.},

abstract = {An analytic form to describe the boundary of an axisymmetric plasma is proposed. This new form uses a generalization of the family of superellipses. The plasma boundaries of existing tokamaks are well described using the compact notation. The form employs eleven parameters of which five are standard, two are generalizations of a standard parameter and four are introduced here. With these same parameters, a closed-form analytic solution can be used to generate new boundaries without x-points. If the desired boundary has x-points, the analytic form can be extended in a manner for which a closed-form solution has not been found, but does have an exact solution that can be found numerically. This new form should be useful for variety of physics studies that use magnetohydrodynamic equilibria, such as the dependence of plasma stability on shape and design of poloidal field coil sets that can support a defined range of shapes.},

As to the W7–X stellarator experiment, the envisaged configurational class—providing the intended experimental flexibility—appears to offer scenarios of safely stable operation.},

These stability analyses have been carried out including the centrifugal effects of toroidal plasma rotation upon the equilibrium, and also inconsistently when the equilibrium is treated as static. The change in plasma stability due to rotation is partially (consistent equilibrium) or wholly (inconsistent treatment) determined by the radial profiles of the plasma density and rotation velocity. It is found that the internal kink mode stability is strongly influenced by small variations in these plasma profiles. The implications of this extreme sensitivity are discussed, with particular reference to experimental data from MAST.},

abstract = {In this work we present a robust and accurate arbitrary order solver for the fixed-boundary plasma equilibria in toroidally axisymmetric geometries. To achieve this we apply the mimetic spectral element formulation presented in [56] to the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation. This approach combines a finite volume discretization with the mixed finite element method. In this way the discrete differential operators (???, ?????, ???.) can be represented exactly and metric and all approximation errors are present in the constitutive relations. The result of this formulation is an arbitrary order method even on highly curved meshes. Additionally, the integral of the toroidal current J?? is exactly equal to the boundary integral of the poloidal field over the plasma boundary. This property can play an important role in the coupling between equilibrium and transport solvers. The proposed solver is tested on a varied set of plasma cross sections (smooth and with an X-point) and also for a wide range of pressure and toroidal magnetic flux profiles. Equilibria accurate up to machine precision are obtained. Optimal algebraic convergence rates of order p+1 and geometric convergence rates are shown for Soloviev solutions (including high Shafranov shifts), field-reversed configuration (FRC) solutions and spheromak analytical solutions. The robustness of the method is demonstrated for non-linear test cases, in particular on an equilibrium solution with a pressure pedestal.},

abstract = {A mechanism is presented that suggests shielded 3D magnetic perturbations can destabilize microinstabilities and enhance the associated anomalous transport. Using local 3D equilibrium theory, shaped tokamak equilibria with small 3D deformations are constructed. In the vicinity of rational magnetic surfaces, the infinite- n ideal MHD ballooning stability boundary is strongly perturbed by the 3D modulations of the local magnetic shear associated with the presence of near-resonant Pfirsch–Schl{\"{u}}ter currents. These currents are driven by 3D components of the magnetic field spectrum even when there is no resonant radial component. The infinite- n ideal ballooning stability boundary is often used as a proxy for the onset of virulent kinetic ballooning modes and associated stiff transport. These results suggest that the achievable pressure gradient may be lowered in the vicinity of low order rational surfaces when 3D magnetic perturbations are applied. This mechanism may provide an explanation for the observed reduction in the peak pressure gradient at the top of the edge pedestal during experiments where edge localized modes have been completely suppressed by applied 3D magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Sustained edge-localized mode (ELM) mitigation has been achieved using resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with a toroidal mode number of n = 4 and n = 6 in lower single null and with n = 3 in connected double null plasmas on MAST. The ELM frequency increases by up to a factor of eight with a similar reduction in ELM energy loss. A threshold current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately linearly with current in the coils. A comparison of the filament structures observed during the ELMs in the natural and mitigated stages shows that the mitigated ELMs have the characteristics of type I ELMs even though their frequency is higher, their energy loss is reduced and the pedestal pressure gradient is decreased. During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these lobes is correlated with the increase in ELM frequency observed. The RMPs produce a clear 3D distortion to the plasma and it is likely that these distortions explain why ELMs are destabilized and hence why ELM mitigation occurs.},

For the specific problem, an elementary path with a minimum cost/time ratio is sought in a directed graph, where two parameters (i.e. cost and time) are associated with each arc and a time window is associated with each node. Indeed, a valid path must satisfy the time window constraints, which are assumed to be of the hard type. Multi-dimensional labelling algorithms are proposed to solve this variant of the classical shortest path problem. Extensive computational tests are carried out on a meaningful number of test problems, with the goal of assessing the behaviour of the proposed approaches. The computational study shows that the introduction of dominance rules and the adoption of a bi-directional search strategy allow the definition of solution approaches that turn out to be very effective in solving the problem under consideration.},

@article{Bradley1977,
abstract = {In this chapter, we present a systematic procedure for solving linear programs. This procedure, called the simplex method, proceeds by moving from one feasible solution to another, at each step improving the value of the objective function. Moreover, the method terminates after a finite number of such transitions. Two characteristics of the simplex method have led to its widespread acceptance as a computational tool. First, the method is robust. It solves any linear program; it detects redundant constraints in the problem formulation; it identifies instances when the objective value is unbounded over the feasible region; and it solves problems with one or more optimal solutions. The method is also self-initiating. It uses itself either to generate an appropriate feasible solution, as required, to start the method, or to show that the problem has no feasible solution. Each of these features will be discussed in this chapter. Second, the simplex method provides much more than just optimal solutions. As byproducts, it indicates how the optimal solution varies as a function of the problem data (cost coefficients, constraint coefficients, and righthand-side data). This information is intimately related to a linear program called the dual to the given problem, and the simplex method automatically solves this dual problem along with the given problem. These characteristics of the method are of primary importance for applications, since data rarely is known with certainty and usually is approximated when formulating a problem. These features will be discussed in detail in the chapters to follow. Before presenting a formal description of the algorithm, we consider some examples. Though elementary, these examples illustrate the essential algebraic and geometric features of the method and motivate the general procedure. 2.1 SIMPLEX METHOD—A PREVIEW Optimal Solutions Consider the following linear program: Maximize z = 0x 1 + 0x 2 − 3x 3 − x 4 + 20, (Objective 1) subject to: x 1 − 3x 3 + 3x 4 = 6, (1) x 2 − 8x 3 + 4x 4 = 4, (2) x j ≥ 0 (j = 1, 2, 3, 4).

We use this connection with matrix polynomials to derive a closed-form expression for the eigenvectors of block tridiagonal matrices, which eliminates the need for their direct calculation and can lead to a faster calculation of eigenvalues.

abstract = {It is becoming widely recognized that our society must transition to low-carbon energy systems to combat global climate change, and renewable energy sources are needed to provide energy security in a world with limited fossil-fuel resources. While many clean power-generation solutions have been proposed and are being developed, our ability to transition to a low-carbon society is prevented by the present lack of clean and renewable energy carriers that can replace the crucial roles that fossil fuels play, due to their abundance, convenience and performance, in global energy trade and transportation. Any future low-carbon energy carriers that aim to displace or supplement fossil fuels must have high energy densities for convenient trade and storage, and should be consumable within efficient high-power-density engines for transportation, heavy machinery, and other off-grid energy applications.Hydrogen and batteries have been widely studied but they are not suitable for use as international energy-trading commodities and they cannot provide the energy density and safety demanded by society. Metal fuels, produced using low-carbon recycling systems powered by clean primary energy, such as solar and wind, promise energy densities that are competitive to fossil fuels with low, or even negative, net carbon dioxide emissions. To date, however, few practical high-power-density end-use devices for generating heat or power from metal fuels have been proposed.This paper proposes a novel concept for power generation in which metal fuels are burned with air in a combustor to provide clean, high-grade heat. The metal-fuel combustion heat can be used directly for industrial or residential heating and can also power external-combustion engines, operating on the Rankine or Stirling cycles, or thermo-electric generators over a wide range of power levels. A design concept is proposed for a metal-fuelled combustor that is based upon extensive experimental and theoretical studies of stabilized and propagating metal flames performed at McGill University. This paper also reviews the fundamental and applied aspects of metal-fuel combustion in order to provide the framework needed to assess any potential metal engine technologies. The energy and power densities of the proposed metal-fuelled zero-carbon heat engines are predicted to be close to current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines, making them an attractive technology for a future low-carbon society.},

abstract = {The application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with a toroidal mode number of n = 3 to connected double null plasmas in the MAST tokamak produces up to a factor of 9 increase in edge-localized mode (ELM) frequency and reduction in plasma energy loss associated with type-I ELMs. A threshold current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately linearly with current in the coils. The effect of the RMPs is found to be scenario dependent. In one scenario the mitigation is only due to a large density pump out event and if the density is recovered by gas puffing a return to type-I ELMs is observed. In another scenario sustained ELM mitigation can be achieved irrespective of the amount of fuelling. Despite a large scan of parameters complete ELM suppression has not been achieved. The results are compared with modelling performed using either the vacuum approximation or including the plasma response. The requirement for a resonant condition, that is an optimum alignment of the perturbation with the plasma, is confirmed by performing a scan in the pitch angle of the applied field.},

Our first result is that the correlation functions of the Schur process are determinants with a kernel that has a nice contour integral representation in terms of the parameters of the process. This general result is then applied to a particular specialization of the Schur process, namely to random 3-dimensional Young diagrams. The local geometry of a large random 3-dimensional diagram is described in terms of a determinantal point process on a 2-dimensional lattice with the incomplete beta function kernel (which generalizes the discrete sine kernel). A brief discussion of the universality of this answer concludes the paper.},

abstract = {We review and test the peeling–ballooning model for edge localized modes (ELMs) and pedestal constraints, a model based upon theoretical analysis of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that can limit the pedestal height and drive ELMs. A highly efficient MHD stability code, ELITE, is used to calculate quantitative stability constraints on the pedestal, including constraints on the pedestal height. Because of the impact of collisionality on the bootstrap current, these pedestal constraints are dependent on the density and temperature separately, rather than simply on the pressure. ELITE stability calculations are directly compared with experimental data for a series of plasmas in which the density is varied and ELM characteristics change. In addition, a technique is developed whereby peeling–ballooning pedestal constraints are calculated as a function of key equilibrium parameters via ELITE calculations using series of model equilibria. This technique is used to successfully compare the expected pedestal height as a function of density, triangularity and plasma current with experimental data. Furthermore, the technique can be applied for parameter ranges beyond the purview of present experiments, and we present a brief projection of peeling–ballooning pedestal constraints for burning plasma tokamak designs.},

One of its consequences is to provide a characterization of equilibria by their values of certain invariants. Finally, conditions are obtained additional to the magnetostatic equations appropriate to the steady state of a plasma slowly diffusing across a magnetic field out of a topologically toroidal region.},

abstract = {A critical issue for fusion-plasma research is the erosion of the first wall of the experimental device due to impulsive heating from repetitive edge magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities known as 'edge-localized modes' ( ELMs). Here, we show that the addition of small resonant magnetic. field perturbations completely eliminates ELMs while maintaining a steady-state high-confinement ( H-mode) plasma. These perturbations induce a chaotic behaviour in the magnetic field lines, which reduces the edge pressure gradient below the ELM instability threshold. The pressure gradient reduction results from a reduction in the particle content of the plasma, rather than an increase in the electron thermal transport. This is inconsistent with the predictions of stochastic electron heat transport theory. These results provide a first experimental test of stochastic transport theory in a highly rotating, hot, collisionless plasma and demonstrate a promising solution to the critical issue of controlling edge instabilities in fusion-plasma devices.},

These distinct responses are a direct measurement of a multimodal magnetic plasma response, with each structure preferentially excited by a different n=2 applied spectrum and preferentially detected on the LFS or HFS. Ideal and resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) calculations find that the LFS measurement is primarily sensitive to the excitation of stable kink modes, while the HFS measurement is primarily sensitive to resonant currents (whether fully shielding or partially penetrated). The resonant currents are themselves strongly modified by kink excitation, with the optimal applied field pitch for pumpout and ELM suppression significantly differing from equilibrium field alignment.},

abstract = {Consider a system made up of a hydromagnetic wave and the slowly varying background fluid in which it propagates. It is shown that both the effect of the background on the wave and that of the wave on the background may be derived from Hamilton's principle using the averaged hydromagnetic Lagrangian density. The waves propagate adiabatically, conserving the wave action, and act on the background via a wave pressure term. Total momentum, angular momentum, and energy are conserved. When many waves are superimposed, as in weak turbulence, the wave kinetic equation replaces the adiabatic conservation equation. The accuracy of the averaging approximation is examined, and it is shown that it may be extended to all orders in the inhomogeneity. Also, Eulerian and Lagrangian averaging are discussed.},

abstract = {In this article, we propose a solution procedure for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). A relaxed version of this problem in which the path does not have to be elementary has been the backbone of a number of solution procedures based on column generation for several important problems, such as vehicle routing and crew pairing. In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the ESPPRC, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem. We present computational experiments of this algorithm for our specific problem and embedded in a column generation scheme for the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.},

We performed a set of reduced-gravity measurements to analyze the flow behavior of granular matter with a quasi-2D hourglass under coarse-vacuum conditions and with a tilting avalanche box. We used the Bremen drop tower and a small centrifuge to achieve residual-gravity levels between 0.01 g and 0.3 g. Both experiments were carried out with basalt and glass grains as well as with two kinds of ordinary sand. For the hourglass experiments, the volume flow through the orifice, the repose and friction angles, and the flow behavior of the particles close to the surface were determined. In the avalanche-box experiment, we measured the duration of the avalanche, the maximum slope angle as well as the width of the avalanche as a function of the gravity level.},

abstract = {This paper presents a description of the spatial and temporal structure$\backslash$nof edge-localized modes (ELMs) observed in the MAST tokamak. Filamentary$\backslash$nenhancements of visible light are observed on photographic images$\backslash$nof the plasma obtained during ELMs. Comparisons with simulations$\backslash$nshow that these filaments are consistent with following field lines$\backslash$nat the outboard edge of the plasma. The toroidal mode number of these$\backslash$nfilaments has been extracted from a study of the discrete peaks observed$\backslash$nin the ion saturation current recorded by a mid-plane reciprocating$\backslash$nprobe. A study of the time delay of these peaks with respect to the$\backslash$nonset of the ELM has been used to calculate an effective radial velocity$\backslash$nfor the expansion of the filaments. A comparison of this derived$\backslash$nradial velocity as a function of distance from the last closed flux$\backslash$nsurface with simulations indicates that the filament is accelerating$\backslash$naway from the plasma. Evidence for the temporal evolution of the$\backslash$nELM comes from studies of outboard mid-plane Thomson scattering density$\backslash$nprofiles. In addition, a study of the toroidal velocity as a function$\backslash$nof radius shows that during an ELM the strong velocity shear near$\backslash$nthe edge of the plasma, normally present in H-modes, is strongly$\backslash$nreduced. The picture that emerges is that the ELM can be viewed as$\backslash$nbeing composed of filamentary structures that are generated on a$\backslash$n100 {\^{A}}µs timescale, accelerate away from the plasma edge, are extended$\backslash$nalong a field line and have a typical toroidal mode number {\~{}}10.

abstract = {The physics of non-axisymmetry is a far more important topic in the theory of toroidal fusion plasmas than might be expected. (1) Even a small toroidal asymmetry in the magnetic field strength, $\delta$ ≡ ∂ ln B/∂$\phi$ ∼ 10-4, can cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. (2) Nevertheless, asymmetries - even large asymmetries $\delta$ ∼ 1 - can give beneficial plasma control and circumvent issues, such as magnetic-configuration maintenance and plasma disruptions, that make axisymmetric fusion devices problematic. Viewed from prospectives that are adequate for designing and studying axisymmetric plasmas, the physics of non-axisymmetric plasmas appears dauntingly difficult. Remarkably, Maxwell's equations provide such strong constraints on the physics of toroidal fusion plasmas that even a black-box model of a plasma answers many important questions. Kinetic theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide further, but more nuanced, constraints. This paper is organized so these constraints can be used as a basis for the innovations and for the extrapolations that are required to go from existing experiments to fusion systems. Outlines are given of a number of calculations that would be of great importance to ITER and to the overall fusion program and that could be carried out now with limited resources.},

Localized stable flow shear produces transport barriers whose extensive and highly successful utilization in fusion devices has made them the primary experimental technique for reducing and even eliminating the rapid turbulent losses of heat and particles that characterize fusion-grade plasmas. These transport barriers occur in different plasma regions with disparate physical properties and in a range of confining configurations, indicating a physical process of unusual universality. Flow shear suppresses turbulence by speeding up turbulent decorrelation. This is a robust feature of advection whenever the straining rate of stable mean flow shear exceeds the nonlinear decorrelation rate. Shear straining lowers correlation lengths in the direction of shear and reduces turbulent amplitudes. It also disrupts other processes that feed into or result from turbulence, including the linear instability of important collective modes, the transport-producing correlations between advecting fluid and advectants, and large-scale spatially connected avalanchelike transport events. In plasmas, regions of stable flow shear can be externally driven, but most frequently are created spontaneously in critical transitions between different plasma states. Shear suppression occurs in hydrodynamics and represents an extension of rapid-distortion theory to a long-time-scale nonlinear regime in two-dimensional stable shear flow. Examples from hydrodynamics include the emergence of coherent vortices in decaying two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence and the reduction of turbulent transport in the stratosphere.},

The accessible part of the MHD stability diagram is determined by computing the bootstrap current and self-consistently evaluating the corresponding pedestal current. This procedure shows that only a small part of peeling–ballooning diagrams is physically accessible. Uncertainties about the foreseen plasma profiles motivate studies evaluating the impact of various parameters on the pedestal limits. We have addressed issues such as the pedestal width, the global performance, pressure peaking, edge current density, internal inductance and plasma shaping. A scaling law for the maximum pedestal pressure in the ITER scenarios is proposed, highlighting that the main dependences are on the plasma current, the edge safety factor, the pedestal width and the internal inductance.},

@article{Bradley1977b,
abstract = {In the preceding chapter on sensitivity analysis, we saw that the shadow-price interpretation of the optimal simplex multipliers is a very useful concept. First, these shadow prices give us directly the marginal worth of an additional unit of any of the resources. Second, when an activity is ''priced out'' using these shadow prices, the opportunity cost of allocating resources to that activity relative to other activities is determined. Duality in linear programming is essentially a unifying theory that develops the relationships between a given linear program and another related linear program stated in terms of variables with this shadow-price interpretation. The importance of duality is twofold. First, fully understanding the shadow-price interpretation of the optimal simplex multipliers can prove very useful in understanding the implications of a particular linear-programming model. Second, it is often possible to solve the related linear program with the shadow prices as the variables in place of, or in conjunction with, the original linear program, thereby taking advantage of some computational efficiencies. The importance of duality for computational procedures will become more apparent in later chapters on network-flow problems and large-scale systems. 4.1 A PREVIEW OF DUALITY We can motivate our discussion of duality in linear programming by considering again the simple example given in Chapter 2 involving the firm producing three types of automobile trailers. Recall that the decision variables are: x 1 = number of flat-bed trailers produced per month, x 2 = number of economy trailers produced per month, x 3 = number of luxury trailers produced per month. The constraining resources of the production operation are the metalworking and woodworking capacities measured in days per month. The linear program to maximize contribution to the firm's overhead (in hundreds of dollars) is: Maximize z = 6x 1 + 14x 2 + 13x 3 , subject to: 1 2 x 1 + 2x 2 + x 3 ≤ 24, x 1 + 2x 2 + 4x 3 ≤ 60, (1) x 1 ≥ 0, x 2 ≥ 0, x 3 ≥ 0.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.In this paper, the elementary single-source all-destinations shortest path problem is considered. Given a directed graph, containing negative cost cycles, the aim is to find paths with minimum cost from a source node to each other node, that do not contain repeated nodes. Two solution strategies are proposed to solve the problem under investigation and their theoretical properties are investigated. The first is a dynamic programming approach, the second method is based on the solution of the k shortest paths problem, where k is considered as a variable. Theoretical aspects related to the innovative proposed strategies to solve the problem at hand are investigated. The practical behaviour of the defined algorithms is evaluated by considering random generated networks and instances derived from vehicle routing benchmark test problems.},

This paper builds on "Accelerated label setting algorithms for the elementary resource constrained shortest path problem" but does not use the pre-processing. Also, it is multi-destination.

Furthermore, there is an "innovative dynamic k shortest paths algorithm", where these resources are not used, and in fact multiple elementary solutions are introduced for each node that has been found to be part of a negative cost cycle. In the next iteration, then,

@article{Loarte2014ELMs,
abstract = {Progress in the definition of the requirements for edge localized mode (ELM) control and the application of ELM control methods both for high fusion performance DT operation and non-active low-current operation in ITER is described. Evaluation of the power fluxes for low plasma current H-modes in ITER shows that uncontrolled ELMs will not lead to damage to the tungsten (W) divertor target, unlike for high-current H-modes in which divertor damage by uncontrolled ELMs is expected. Despite the lack of divertor damage at lower currents, ELM control is found to be required in ITER under these conditions to prevent an excessive contamination of the plasma by W, which could eventually lead to an increased disruptivity. Modelling with the non-linear MHD code JOREK of the physics processes determining the flow of energy from the confined plasma onto the plasma-facing components during ELMs at the ITER scale shows that the relative contribution of conductive and convective losses is intrinsically linked to the magnitude of the ELM energy loss. Modelling of the triggering of ELMs by pellet injection for DIII-D and ITER has identified the minimum pellet size required to trigger ELMs and, from this, the required fuel throughput for the application of this technique to ITER is evaluated and shown to be compatible with the installed fuelling and tritium re-processing capabilities in ITER. The evaluation of the capabilities of the ELM control coil system in ITER for ELM suppression is carried out (in the vacuum approximation) and found to have a factor of ∼2 margin in terms of coil current to achieve its design criterion, although such a margin could be substantially reduced when plasma shielding effects are taken into account. The consequences for the spatial distribution of the power fluxes at the divertor of ELM control by three-dimensional (3D) fields are evaluated and found to lead to substantial toroidal asymmetries in zones of the divertor target away from the separatrix. Therefore, specifications for the rotation of the 3D perturbation applied for ELM control in order to avoid excessive localized erosion of the ITER divertor target are derived. It is shown that a rotation frequency in excess of 1 Hz for the whole toroidally asymmetric divertor power flux pattern is required (corresponding to n Hz frequency in the variation of currents in the coils, where n is the toroidal symmetry of the perturbation applied) in order to avoid unacceptable thermal cycling of the divertor target for the highest power fluxes and worst toroidal power flux asymmetries expected. The possible use of the in-vessel vertical stability coils for ELM control as a back-up to the main ELM control systems in ITER is described and the feasibility of its application to control ELMs in low plasma current H-modes, foreseen for initial ITER operation, is evaluated and found to be viable for plasma currents up to 5–10 MA depending on modelling assumptions.},

Remarkable correspondences between the Poisson brackets of inertialess Hall MHD and inertial MHD (which has electron inertia, but not the Hall drift) and extended MHD (which has both effects) are established. The helicities (two in all) for each of these models are obtained through these correspondences. The commonality of all the extended MHD models is traced to the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms, which are closely associated with the canonical momenta of the two underlying species. The Lie-dragging of these 2-forms by suitable velocities also leads to the correct equations of motion. The Hall MHD Poisson bracket is analyzed in detail, the Jacobi identity is verified through a detailed proof, and this proof ensures the Jacobi identity for the Poisson brackets of all the models.

This is used in structural geology and geomechanics for the evaluation of the deformation and perturbed stress field associated with surfaces of displacement discontinuity. Such optimization significantly reduces (i) the time and memory needed for the resolution of the system of equations, but more importantly (ii) the time needed for the post-processing at observation points where the deformation and the perturbed stress field are evaluated. Specifically, it is shown that the H -matrix structure used with the ACA, clearly captures the kernel smoothness during the post-processing stage according to the field point positions, and optimizes the computation accordingly. Combined with the parallelization on multi-core processors, this technique allows intensive computations to be done on personal desktop and laptop computers. Numerical simulations are presented, showing the advantages of such optimizations compared to the standard method. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The magnitude of the JT-60U ripple losses is$\backslash$nsufficient to induce counter-toroidal rotation in co-injected plasma.$\backslash$nThe influence of ripple losses was demonstrated at q(95) = 5.1: reducing$\backslash$nripple losses by approximate to 2 (from 4.3 to 1.9 MW) by replacing$\backslash$npositive with negative neutral beam injection at approximately constant$\backslash$nPin resulted in an increased P-ped in JT-60U, providing a good match to$\backslash$nfull power JET H-modes. At the same time, the counter-toroidal rotation$\backslash$ndecreased. Physics mechanisms relating ripple losses to pedestal$\backslash$nperformance are not yet identified, and the possible role of velocity$\backslash$nshear in the pedestal stability, as well as the possible influence of$\backslash$nripple on thermal ion transport are briefly discussed. Toroidal rotation$\backslash$nof the ITER reference inductive Q = 10 H-mode is predicted to be rather$\backslash$nlow, of the order of similar to 1/10 of the frequency of typical JET$\backslash$nH-modes. Nonetheless, fast ion ripple losses in that scenario are also$\backslash$npredicted to be negligible (less than or similar to 1 {\%}), and therefore$\backslash$nplasma toroidal rotation slow-down or ripple-induced counter-rotation$\backslash$nshould not affect pedestal parameters and stability in ITER. Finally,$\backslash$nthe possible effect of ripple on thermal transport may deserve more$\backslash$nattention in future experiments and modelling, since the ripple$\backslash$nmagnitude of ITER is intermediate between that of JET and JT-60U.},

abstract = {We present a distributed-memory library for computations with dense structured matrices. A matrix is considered structured if its off-diagonal blocks can be approximated by a rank-deficient matrix with low numerical rank. Here, we use Hierarchically Semi-Separable representations (HSS). Such matrices appear in many applications, e.g., finite element methods, boundary element methods, etc. Exploiting this structure allows for fast solution of linear systems and/or fast computation of matrix-vector products, which are the two main building blocks of matrix computations. The compression algorithm that we use, that computes the HSS form of an input dense matrix, relies on randomized sampling with a novel adaptive sampling mechanism. We discuss the parallelization of this algorithm and also present the parallelization of structured matrix-vector product, structured factorization and solution routines. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on large problems from different academic and industrial applications, on up to 8,000 cores. This work is part of a more global effort, the STRUMPACK (STRUctured Matrices PACKage) software package for computations with sparse and dense structured matrices. Hence, although useful on their own right, the routines also represent a step in the direction of a distributed-memory sparse solver.},

It is further shown that the problem cannot be reduced further than to a two-dimensional partial differential equation. Next, the generalized ballooning equation is solved analytically for a circular tokamak equilibrium with sonic flows, but with a small rotation shear compared to the sound speed. With this ordering, the centrifugal forces are comparable to the pressure gradient forces driving the instability, but coupling of the mode with the sound wave is avoided. A new stability criterion is derived that explicitly demonstrates that flow shear is stabilizing at constant centrifugal force gradient.},

@article{turnbull2013comparisons,
abstract = {With the installation of non-axisymmetric coil systems on major tokamaks for the purpose of studying the prospects of ELM-free operation, understanding the plasma response to the applied fields is a crucial issue. Application of different response models, using standard tools, to DIII-D discharges with applied non-axisymmetric fields from internal coils, is shown to yield qualitatively different results. The plasma response can be treated as an initial value problem, following the system dynamically from an initial unperturbed state, or from a nearby perturbed equilibrium approach, and using both linear and nonlinear models [A. D. Turnbull, Nucl. Fusion 52, 054016 (2012)]. Criteria are discussed under which each of the approaches can yield a valid response. In the DIII-D cases studied, these criteria show a breakdown in the linear theory despite the small 10 − 3 relative magnitude of the applied magnetic field perturbations in this case. For nonlinear dynamical evolution simulations to reach a saturated nonlinear steady state, appropriate damping mechanisms need to be provided for each normal mode comprising the response. Other issues arise in the technical construction of perturbed flux surfaces from a displacement and from the presence of near nullspace normal modes. For the nearby equilibrium approach, in the absence of a full 3D equilibrium reconstruction with a controlled comparison, constraints relating the 2D system profiles to the final profiles in the 3D system also need to be imposed to assure accessibility. The magnetic helicity profile has been proposed as an appropriate input to a 3D equilibrium calculation and tests of this show the anticipated qualitative behavior.},

abstract = {Resistive ballooning modes in general three-dimensional configurations are studied on the basis of the equations of motion of resistive MHD. Assuming small, constant resistivity and perturbations localized transversally to the magnetic field, a stability criterion is derived in the form of a coupled system of two second-order differential equations. This criterion contains several limiting cases, in particular the ideal ballooning mode criterion and criteria for the stability of symmetric systems. Assuming small growth rates, analytical results are derived by multiple-length-scale expansion techniques. Instabilities are found, their growth rates scaling as fractional powers of the resistivity},

abstract = {The boundary of the tokamak core plasma, or scrape-off layer, is normally characterized in terms of average parameters such as density, temperature and e-folding lengths suggesting diffusive losses. However, as is shown in this paper, localized filamentary structures play an important role in determining the radial efflux in both L mode and during edge localized modes (ELMs) on MAST. Understanding the size, poloidal and toroidal localization and the outward radial extent of these filaments is crucial in order to calculate their effect on power loading both on the first wall and the divertor target plates in future devices. The spatial and temporal evolution of filaments observed on MAST in L-mode and ELMs have been compared and contrasted in order to confront the predictions of various models that have been proposed to predict filament propagation and in particular ELM energy losses.},

abstract = {Because experiment/model comparisons in magnetic confinement fusion have not yet satisfied the requirements for validation as understood broadly, a set of approaches to validating mathematical models and numerical algorithms are recommended as good practices. Previously identified procedures, such as verification, qualification, and analysis of error and uncertainty, remain important. However, particular challenges intrinsic to fusion plasmas and physical measurement therein lead to identification of new or less familiar concepts that are also critical in validation. These include the primacy hierarchy, which tracks the integration of measurable quantities, and sensitivity analysis, which assesses how model output is apportioned to different sources of variation. The use of validation metrics for individual measurements is extended to multiple measurements, with provisions for the primacy hierarchy and sensitivity. This composite validation metric is essential for quantitatively evaluating comparisons with experiments. To mount successful and credible validation in magnetic fusion, a new culture of validation is envisaged.},

In this energy principle the perturbed magnetic field in the vacuum is derived from a vector potential. In the present investigation the energy principle is formulated with the help of a magnetic scalar potential instead of the vector potential, which simplifies the application of the principle. The many-valued character of the scalar potential assures that this description is equivalent to that using the vector potential. The nature of this many-valuedness is thoroughly investigated.},

@article{Chapman2014,
abstract = {An increase in ELM frequency has been demonstrated in MAST by applying resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with toroidal mode number, n RMP = 2, 3, 4, 6. It has been observed that the mitigated ELM frequency increases with the amplitude of the applied field provided it is above a critical threshold. This threshold value depends on the mode number of the RMP, with higher n RMP having a larger critical value. For the same ELM frequency, the reduction in the peak heat load on the divertor plates is approximately the same for all RMP configurations. The RMPs give rise to perturbations to the plasma shape, with lobe structures occurring due to the tangled magnetic fields near the X-point, and corrugations of the plasma boundary at the midplane. The X-point lobe length increases linearly with the applied field when above a threshold, with RMPs of higher toroidal mode number giving rise to longer lobes for the same applied resonant field. Similarly, the midplane displacements increase with the applied field strength, though the corrugation amplitude is less dependent upon the RMP configuration. For all n RMP , the RMPs result in enhanced particle transport and a reduction in the pedestal pressure gradient caused by an increased pedestal width, which is found to be consistent with a decrease in the critical pressure at which infinite- n ballooning modes are driven unstable in non-axisymmetric plasmas. The plasma rotation braking is strongest for lowest n RMP whilst the degradation of access to H-mode resultant from the application of RMPs are non-monotonic in n RMP , with the optimal case for both occurring for n RMP = 4. Whilst there are advantages and disadvantages for all RMP configurations, the configurations found to be optimised in terms of pedestal degradation, access to H-mode, plasma rotation and distortion to the plasma configuration in MAST are n RMP = 3 or 4, consistent with the configurations anticipated for use in ITER.},

abstract = {A new type of axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium is presented. It is characterized by a region of pressure and safety factor variation with a short scale length imposed as a perturbation. The equilibrium consistent with these profile variations can be calculated by means of an asymptotic expansion. The flexibility obtained by generating such equilibria allows for a close examination of the mechanisms that are relevant to ballooning instabilities - ideal-MHD modes with large toroidal mode number. The so-called first and second regions of stability against these modes are seen well within the limits of validity of the asymptotic expansion. It appears that the modes must be localized in regions with small values of the local shear of the magnetic field. The second region of stability occurs where the local shear is large throughout the range where the magnetic-field-line curvature is destabilizing.},

This method can be implemented in the context of the finite element method to compute the solution to inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions; it allows to overcome cases where the Neumann problem otherwise admits an infinite number of solutions. As a test application, we solve the Grad-Shafranov boundary problem in a toroidally symmetric geometry. Solving the regularized Neumann response problem is found to be several orders of magnitudes more efficient than solving the Dirichlet problem, which makes the approach competitive with the boundary element method without the need to derive a Green function. In the context of the boundary element method, the operator transformation technique can also be applied to obtain the response of the Grad-Shafranov equation from the toroidal Laplace n=1 response matrix using a simple matrix transformation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Starting from the generalized Ampere-Laplace law, in the framework of a slowly varying time-dependent field approximation, the magnetic vector potential is written in terms of its empirical referent, i. e. the conduction current. Therefore, once the currents are known, our approach allows a clear and univocal physical determination of A overcoming the mathematical indeterminacy due to the gauge transformations. We have no need to fix a gauge, since for slowly varying time-dependent electric and magnetic fields, the natural gauge for A is the Coulomb one. We stress the difference between our approach and those usually presented in the literature. Finally, a physical interpretation of the magnetic vector potential is discussed and some examples of calculation of A are analysed.},

abstract = {Type-I Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) have been mitigated in MAST through the application of n = 3, 4, and 6 resonant magnetic perturbations. For each toroidal mode number of the non-axisymmetric applied fields, the frequency of the ELMs has been increased significantly, and the peak heat flux on the divertor plates reduced commensurately. This increase in ELM frequency occurs despite a significant drop in the edge pressure gradient, which would be expected to stabilise the peeling-ballooning modes thought to be responsible for type-I ELMs. Various mechanisms which could cause a destabilisation of the peeling-ballooning modes are presented, including pedestal widening, plasma rotation braking, three dimensional corrugation of the plasma boundary, and the existence of radially extended lobe structures near to the X-point. This leads to a model aimed at resolving the apparent dichotomy of ELM control, which is to say ELM suppression occurring due to the pedestal pressure reduction below the peeling-ballooning stability boundary, whilst the reduction in pressure can also lead to ELM mitigation, which is ostensibly a destabilisation of peeling-ballooning modes. In the case of ELM mitigation, the pedestal broadening, 3d corrugation, or lobes near the X-point degrade ballooning stability so much that the pedestal recovers rapidly to cross the new stability boundary at lower pressure more frequently, whilst in the case of suppression, the plasma parameters are such that the particle transport reduces the edge pressure below the stability boundary, which is only mildly affected by negligible rotation braking, small edge corrugation or short, broad lobe structures.},

It implements and solves the intermediate-to-high-n ideal linear magnetohydrodynamic stability theory extended to full edge 3-D magnetic toroidal configurations in previous work [1]. The features that make PB3D unique are the assumptions on the perturbation structure through intermediate-to-high mode numbers n in general 3-D configurations, while allowing for displacement of the plasma edge. This makes PB3D capable of very efficient calculations of the full 3-D stability for the output of multiple equilibrium codes. As first verification, it is checked that results from the stability code MISHKA [2], which considers axisymmetric equilibrium configurations, are accurately reproduced, and these are then successfully extended to 3-D configurations, through comparison with COBRA [3], as well as using checks on physical consistency. The non-intuitive 3-D results presented serve as a tentative first proof of the capabilities of the code.},

These are thought to be important for the behavior of edge localized modes and for the limit of the size of the pedestal that governs the high confinement H-mode. The end point of the derivation is a set of coupled second order ordinary differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions that minimize the perturbed energy and that can be solved to find the growth rate of the perturbations. This theory allows of the evaluation of 3D effects on edge plasma stability in tokamaks such as those associated with the toroidal ripple due to the finite number of toroidal field coils, the application of external 3D fields for elm control, local modification of the magnetic field in the vicinity of ferromagnetic components such as the test blanket modules in ITER, etc. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Rudimentary concepts of finite-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian dynamics are reviewed, in the context of the passive advection of a scalar or tracer field by a fluid. The notions of integrability, invariant-tori, chaos, overlap criteria, and invariant-tori breakup are described in this context. Preparatory to the introduction of field theories, systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, elements of functional calculus and action principles of mechanics are reviewed. The action principle for the ideal compressible fluid is described in terms of Lagrangian or material variables. Hamiltonian systems in terms of noncanonical variables are presented, including several examples of Eulerian or inviscid fluid dynamics. Lie group theory sufficient for the treatment of reduction is reviewed. The reduction from Lagrangian to Eulerian variables is treated along with Clebsch variable decompositions. Stability in the canonical and noncanonical Hamiltonian contexts is described. Sufficient conditions for stability, such as Rayleigh-like criteria, are seen to be only sufficient in the general case because of the existence of negative-energy modes, which are possessed by interesting fluid equilibria. Linearly stable equilibria with negative energy modes are argued to be unstable when nonlinearity or dissipation is added. The energy-Casimir method is discussed and a variant of it that depends upon the notion of dynamical accessibility is described. The energy content of a perturbation about a general fluid equilibrium is calculated using three methods.},

To carry out this minimization, small displacements are made around a convenient set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from a nearby three-dimensional equilibrium that assumes nested surfaces. Because the changes of the magnetic fields and pressure are small, corresponding to small changes in the initial magnetic and kinetic energies, solutions for the linearized perturbations can be used to rapidly and iteratively find lower energy states with magnetic islands. A physics-based preconditioner is developed to accelerate the convergence of the iterative procedure to obtain an ideal MHD equilibrium with broken magnetic surfaces (islands).},

This paper derives a new regularization technique to evaluate the origin intensity factor on the Neumann boundary condition without the need of sample solution and nodes as in the traditional SBM. We also modify the inverse interpolation technique in the traditional SBM to get rid of the perplexing sample nodes in the calculation of the origin intensity factor on the Dirichlet boundary condition. It is noted that this new SBM retains all merits of the traditional SBM being truly meshless, free of integration, mathematically simple, and easy-to-program without the requirement of a fictitious boundary as in the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). We examine the new SBM by the four benchmark infinite domain problems to verify its applicability, stability, and accuracy. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%}). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1{\%}, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

@inproceedings{Bussard2006,
abstract = {Success has been achieved from research and development work conducted since 1986 on a unique concept for creating and controlling nuclear fusion reactions, in an inertial-electrodynamic fusion (IEF) device of special, quasi-spherical configuration. Final design insights were proven by experiment in Oct/Nov 2005, from which full-scale designs can be determined. This allows demonstration of full-scale, clean, nuclear fusion power systems, based on use of p+B11 3 He4. This demonstration will require about {\$}200M (USD) over 5 years, with an IEF machine of 2.5-3 m in diameter, operated at over 100 MW. It will open the door to superformance, practical, economical spaceflight, as well as clean fusion power, and mark the end of dependence on fossil fuels. The main point of this paper is to present these results of EMC2s 20 years of study and research of this approach to clean fusion power. This concept derives from early work (1960s) of P. T. Farnsworth and R. L. Hirsch (F/H), who used spherical screen grids biased to high potentials to energize and accelerate ions to the center, where fusion occurred. Ion collisions with grids gave unavoidable losses, limiting power gain to less than 0.001. The EMC2 device avoids these by using energetic electrons, trapped in a quasi-spherical polyhedral magnetic field, to generate a spherical electric potential well. Ions dropped into this well at its edge will accelerate towards its center increasing in density and kinetic energy, collide at high energy, and make fusion. By this unique design, the power loss problem is shifted from grid collision of ions (F/H) to that of electron transport losses across high B fields to the confining magnets. The two competing phenomena, power loss and fusion generation, are thus decoupled by the basic design approach, and each can be optimized separately. The concept was invented by Dr. R.W. Bussard in 1983, patented in 1989 (and lastly in 2006), and studied by EMC2 since 1986. Design studies of IEF-based space propulsion (AIAA Prop. Conf, 1993,97; IAC, Graz, 1994, Toulouse, 2001) show that this can yield engine systems whose thrust/mass ratio is 1000x higher for any given specific impulse (Isp), over a range of 1000 {\textless} Isp {\textless} 1E6 sec, than any other advanced propulsion means, with consequent 100x reduction in costs of spaceflight.},

abstract = {The transport barrier which exists at the plasma edge in the high-confinement (H-mode) regime is now recognized as important to global energy confinement. Recently, detailed measurements of the width and height of barriers in electron and ion density and/or temperature have been made on several divertor tokamaks. These results are reviewed, with an emphasis on scalings of the pedestal height and width. Many experiments observe situations in which the limiting pedestal pressure gradient is well described by ideal ballooning stability. In some cases the extreme edge is in the `second stable' regime. Differences between the widths $\Delta$ of pedestals in electron and ion temperature and densities are noted in several experiments. Some reported scalings are $\Delta$ Ti = 3.3($\epsilon$) 1/2 $\rho$ i,pol on JT-60U, and $\Delta$ Pe / R $\beta$ pol,ped 0.4 on DIII-D. $\Delta$ Te is independent of plasma current in many experiments. Theoretical modelling of the fully developed H-mode pedestal is reviewed. Several recent predictions of the pedestal parameters and their scalings are outlined and compared with experiments.},

abstract = {We develop a multiple interface variational model, comprising multiple Taylor-relaxed plasma regions separated by ideal MHD barriers. The magnetic field in each region is Beltrami, ∇ {\{}$\backslash$times{\}} B = $\mu$ B , and the pressure constant. Between regions the pressure, field strength, and rotational transform may have step changes at the ideal barrier. A principle motivation is the development of a mathematically rigorous ideal MHD model to describe intrinsically 3D equilibria, with nonzero internal pressure, using robust KAM surfaces as the barriers. This article chiefly addresses whether the stability of two interface configurations with continuous rotational transform, but vanishing interface separation, is different from the stability of a single interface configuration with jump in the rotational transform. To make the problem analytically tractable, we derive the equilibria and stability of a multi-interface plasma in a periodic cylinder, generalizing the cylindrical treatment of Kaiser and Uecker (2004 Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 57 1--17). For two interfaces with no jump in rotational transform, we show that one eigenmode has in-phase interface displacements, and an eigenvalue that converges to the single barrier case in the limit of vanishing interface width. The complementary eigenmode is out-of-phase, and highly unstable. Physically, the unstable eigenmode is driven by the parallel current, and caused by the high shear required to match the different rotational transform on each interface. In the limit that the interface separation vanishes, the shear and parallel current density become infinite, and the parallel current between the interfaces nonzero. Surfaces with out-of-phase displacements will then collide, unless the amplitude goes to zero as the interface separation goes to zero. These results suggest the hypothesis that KAM barriers with different irrational rotational transform on either side may be allowable without violating nonlinear stability.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of checking whether a network with positive and negative costs on its arcs contains a negative cost cycle. The Negative Cost Cycle Detection (NCCD) problem is one of the more fundamental problems in network design and finds applications in a number of domains ranging from Network Optimization and Operations Research to Constraint Programming and System Verification. As per the literature, approaches to this problem have been either Relaxation-based or Contraction-based. We introduce a fundamentally new approach for negative cost cycle detection; our approach, which we term as the Stressing Algorithm, is based on exploiting the connections between the NCCD problem and the problem of checking whether a system of difference constraints is feasible. The Stressing Algorithm is an incremental, comparison-based procedure which is as efficient as the fastest known comparison-based algorithm for this problem. In particular, on a network with n vertices and m edges, the Stressing Algorithm takes O (m ??? n) time to detect the presence of a negative cost cycle or to report that none exists. A very important feature of the Stressing Algorithm is that it uses zero extra space; this is in marked contrast to all known algorithms that require?? (n) extra space. It is well known that the NCCD problem is closely related to the Single Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) problem, i.e., the problem of determining the shortest path distances of all the vertices in a network, from a specified source; indeed most algorithms in the literature for the NCCD problem are modifications of approaches to the SSSP problem. At this juncture, it is not clear whether the Stressing Algorithm could be extended to solve the SSSP problem, even if O (n) extra space is available. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Freidberg2015,
abstract = {This paper attempts to bridge the gap between tokamak reactor design and plasma physics. The analysis demonstrates that the overall design of a tokamak fusion reactor is determined almost entirely by the constraints imposed by nuclear physics and fusion engineering. Virtually, no plasma physics is required to determine the main design parameters of a reactor: a, R0, B0, Ti, Te, p, n, $\tau$E, I. The one exception is the value of the toroidal current I , which depends upon a combination of engineering and plasma physics. This exception, however, ultimately has a major impact on the feasibility of an attractive tokamak reactor. The analysis shows that the engineering/nuclear physics design makes demands on the plasma physics that must be satisfied in order to generate power. These demands are substituted into the well-known operational constraints arising in tokamak physics: the Troyon limit, Greenwald limit, kink stability limit, and bootstrap fraction limit. Unfortunately, a tokamak reactor designed on the basis of standard engineering and nuclear physics constraints does not scale to a reactor. Too much current is required to achieve the necessary confinement time for ignition. The combination of achievable bootstrap current plus current drive is not sufficient to generate the current demanded by the engineering design. Several possible solutions are discussed in detail involving advances in plasma physics or engineering. The main contribution of the present work is to demonstrate that the basic reactor design and its plasma physics consequences can be determined simply and analytically. The analysis thus provides a crisp, compact, logical framework that will hopefully lead to improved physical intuition for connecting plasma physic to tokamak reactor design.},

abstract = {The stability of a general toroidal MHD equilibrium with a continuous pressure profile is investigated for the case where the fluid is surrounded by vacuum. It is found that a disturbance which is localized near the free boundary grows exponentially in time unless a certain necessary criterion is satisfied. Because of the weaker boundary condition, this criterion imposes a more stringent restriction on the configuration than does Mercier's criterion near the boundary. For the cylindrically symmetric case the criterion requires a decrease of the rotational transform and yields a critical relation between the shear and the pressure gradient.},

abstract = {The traditional view regarding the reduction of turbulence-induced transport across a stable sheared flow invokes a reduction of the characteristic length scale in the direction perpendicular to the flow as a result of the shearing and stretching of eddies caused by the differential pull exerted in the direction of the flow. A reduced effective transport coefficient then suffices to capture the reduction, that can then be readily incorporated into a transport model. However, recent evidence from gyrokinetic simulations of the toroidal ion-temperature-gradient mode suggests that the dynamics of turbulent transport across sheared flows changes in a more fundamental manner, and that the use of reduced effective transport coefficients fails to capture the full dynamics that may exhibit both subdiffusion and non-Gaussian statistics. In this contribution, after briefly reviewing these results, we propose some candidates for the physical mechanisms responsible for endowing transport with such non-diffusive characteristics, backing these proposals with new numerical gyrokinetic data.},

abstract = {The critical node detection problem (CNDP) aims to fragment a graph G=(V,E) by removing a set of vertices R with cardinality |R|≤k, such that the residual graph has minimum pairwise connectivity for user-defined value k. Existing optimization algorithms are incapable of finding a good set R in graphs with many thousands or millions of vertices due to the associated computational cost. Hence, there exists a need for a time- and space-efficient approach for evaluating the impact of removing any v∈V in the context of the CNDP. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on a modified depth-first search that requires O(k(|V|+|E|)) time complexity. We employ the method within in a greedy algorithm for quickly identifying R. Our experimental results consider small- (≤250 nodes) and medium-sized (≤25,000 nodes) networks, where it is possible to compare to known optimal solutions or results obtained by other heuristics. Additionally, we show results using six real-world networks. The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to vertex- and edge-weighted variants of the CNDP.},

@article{Pfirsch1993,
abstract = {Explosive phenomena such as internal disruptions in toroidal discharges and solar flares are difficult to explain in terms of linear instabilities. A plasma approaching a linear stability limit can, however, become nonlinearly and explosively unstable, with noninfinitesimal perturbations even before the marginal state is reached. For such investigations, a nonlinear extension of the usual MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) energy principle is helpful. (This was obtained by Merkel and Schl{\"{u}}ter, Sitzungsberichted. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., Munich, 1976, No. 7, for Cartesian coordinate systems.) A coordinate system independent Eulerian formulation for the Lagrangian allowing for equilibria with flow and with built‐in conservation laws for mass, magnetic flux, and entropy is developed in this paper which is similar to Newcomb's Lagrangian method of 1962 [Nucl. Fusion, Suppl., Pt. II, 452 (1962)]. For static equilibria nonlinear stability is completely determined by the potential energy. For a potential energy which contains second‐ and nth order or some more general contributions only, it is shown in full generality that linearly unstable and marginally stable systems are explosively unstable even for infinitesimal perturbations; linearly absolutely stable systems require finite initial perturbations. For equilibria with Abelian symmetries symmetry breaking initial perturbations are needed, which should be observed in numerical simulations. Nonlinear stability is proved for two simple examples, m=0 perturbations of a Bennet Z‐pinch and z‐independent perturbations of a $\theta$ pinch. The algebra for treating these cases reduces considerably if symmetries are taken into account from the outset, as suggested by M. N. Rosenbluth (private communication, 1992).},

abstract = {In this paper, various types of so-called edge localized mode (ELM), an MHD instability occurring in the edge of H-mode plasmas, are discussed. A phenomenological classification based on experimental observations from several experiments is given. ELMs affect the confinement of both energy and particles, with a stronger degradation of particle confinement. Thus, ELMs provide particle control in the H-mode, allowing steady-state operation at only modest confinement degradation. However, large ELMs may lead to unacceptable power loads on the divertor plates of future large fusion experiments and, thus, active control of ELM type and characteristics is required. At present, three control schemes have been demonstrated, namely dynamic variation of the plasma shape, application of resonant magnetic perturbations and control of the energy flux through the separatrix by additional radiation.},

abstract = {I n 1749 Benjamin Franklin made a fundamental discovery—that lightning is an electrical discharge between a thundercloud and Earth. Such a discharge can only occur if the atmosphere, which is normally an insulator, undergoes electrical breakdown. Therein lies our first mystery. The conventional breakdown taught in textbooks originates with free electrons heated in an electric field. Fast electrons in the tail of the thermal distribution function have enough energy—about 10–20 eV—to ionize matter and therefore to generate new free electrons. Electrons with lower energies disappear when they recombine with the ionized molecules in the air. When the electric field E exceeds a threshold, E {\textgreater} Ethr , the generation rate of new electrons from ionization exceeds their recombination rate, and the number of free electrons begins to exponentially increase: Electrical breakdown occurs. Because the electrons responsible for ionization are out in the high-energy tail of the distribution, the mean electron energy e at which breakdown occurs does not normally exceed several electron volts. For instance, in air, e 2 eV. For conventional breakdown, Ethr is proportional to the number density of molecules. In air at atmospheric pressure, Ethr 2 MV/m. All electric field measurements in thunderclouds, however, reveal values substantially less than those needed for conventional breakdown. 1 This is the long-standing mystery about lightning's origin.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.The ability to sustain magnetically confined plasma in a state of stable equilibrium is crucial for optimal and cost-effective operations of fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators. The Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC) is the de-facto serial application used by fusion scientists to compute magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria and study the physics of three dimensional plasmas in confined configurations. Modern fusion energy experiments have larger system scales with more interactive experimental workflows, both demanding faster analysis turnaround times on computational workloads that are stressing the capabilities of sequential VMEC. In this paper, we present PARVMEC, an efficient, parallel version of its sequential counterpart, capable of scaling to thousands of processors on distributed memory machines. PARVMEC is a non-linear code, with multiple numerical physics modules, each with its own computational complexity. A detailed speedup analysis supported by scaling results on 1,024 cores of a Cray XC30 supercomputer is presented. Depending on the mode of PARVMEC execution, speedup improvements of one to two orders of magnitude are reported. PARVMEC equips fusion scientists for the first time with a state-of-the-art capability for rapid, high fidelity analyses of magnetically confined plasmas at unprecedented scales.},

The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.},

abstract = {In gyrokinetic simulations, thousands of degrees of freedom are available to contribute to the fluctuation spectrum. For wavevectors with a single linear instability, the unstable eigenmode accounts for only one of these degrees of freedom. Little has been known about the role of the remaining fluctuations in the turbulent dynamics. In this paper, these fluctuations are characterized as modes in mode decompositions of gyrokinetic distribution functions from nonlinear simulations. This analysis reveals the excitation of a hierarchy of damped modes at the same perpendicular scales as the driving instabilities. Two effects of these subdominant modes are described: First, these damped modes define a potent energy sink, creating a situation where energy drive and energy dissipation peak at the same perpendicular scales. Second, damped modes with tearing parity (even parity about the outboard midplane for Ajj fluctuations) are driven to significant amplitudes and facilitate the development of magnetic stochasticity in electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations.},

abstract = {The peeling-ballooning model for edge localized modes (ELMs) and pedestal constraints, based on ideal MHD instabilities driven by pressure gradients and current in the edge barrier region, has been broadly applied toward understanding ELM and pedestal behaviour in a number of tokamak experiments. Due in part to multiple driving terms, multiple wavelengths and second stability access physics, the peeling-ballooning stability limits which are proposed to constrain the pedestal and trigger ELMs depend sensitively on many details of the tokamak equilibrium. Here we present a technique for characterizing these stability constraints as a function of important parameters, using carefully constructed model equilibria. We discuss comparisons of calculated stability constraints to observed pedestal behaviour, in which an encouraging level of agreement is found. We then present results of an extensive series of calculations which characterize, the peeling-ballooning stability constraints as a function-of pedestal width, magnetic field, plasma current, density, and triangularity.},

This provides expressions for the eccentricity of the constant pressure surfaces as well as for their displacements, and for both the magnitude and the curvature of the external field that must be provided to support the equilibrium. Scaling considerations are invoked to show how the external field must be altered to compress the plasma to a smaller major radius and thus obtain additional heating. Elementary hydromagnetic considerations indicate that the configuration may be stable with respect to modes which have the symmetry of the equilibrium.

Unlike analytical work in a cylindrical approximation, numerical work finds the modes are stable. The plasma's separatrix might stabilize modes, but makes analytical and numerical work difficult. We generalize a cylindrical model to toroidal separatrix geometry, finding one parameter Delta' determines stability. The conformal transformation method is generalized to allow nonzero derivatives of a function on a boundary, and calculation of the equilibrium vacuum field allows Delta' to be found analytically. As a boundary more closely approximates a separatrix, we find the energy principle indicates instability, but the growth rate asymptotes to zero.},

abstract = {Three algorithms to evaluate toroidal harmonics, i.e., Legendre functions of integral order and half-odd degree of the first and second kinds for real arguments larger than one, are presented. The first algorithm (DTORH1) allows the evaluation of the set {\{}Pn-1/2m(x), Qn-1/2m(x){\}} for fixed (integer and positive) values of m and n = 0, 1, ..., N. The algorithms DTORH2 and DTORH3 extend the method used in DTORH1 to obtain the set {\{}Pn-1/2m(x), Qn-1/2m(x){\}} for m = 0, ..., M and n = 0, 1, ..., N. The output of DTORH2 is equivalent to the result of the application of DTORH1 M times (m = 0, 1, ..., M). However, due to the organization of the algorithm, DTORH2 is faster than DTORH1 when several orders and degrees are calculated. DTORH2 is better suited than DTORH3 when high orders and degrees are needed. On the other hand DTORH3, though more restrictive on the maximum evaluable degrees N, is even faster than DTORH2. Our tests of accuracy, show that the three codes achieve a precision of one part in 1012. We discuss the performance of our codes, their speed and their range of validity. The application of the algorithms to solve Laplace's and Poisson's equations in toroidal coordinates is discussed and an explicit numerical example is shown.},

abstract = {Toroidal symmetry is an important concept for plasma confinement; it allows the existence of nested flux surface MHD equilibria and conserved invariants for particle motion. However, perfect symmetry is unachievable in realistic toroidal plasma devices. For example, tokamaks have toroidal ripple due to discrete field coils, optimized stellarators do not achieve exact quasi-symmetry, the plasma itself continually seeks lower energy states through helical 3D deformations, and reactors will likely have non-uniform distributions of ferritic steel near the plasma. Also, some level of designed-in 3D magnetic field structure is now anticipated for most concepts in order to provide the plasma control needed for a stable, steady-state fusion reactor. Such planned 3D field structures can take many forms, ranging from tokamaks with weak 3D edge localized mode suppression fields to stellarators with more dominant 3D field structures. This motivates the development of physics models that are applicable across the full range of 3D devices. Ultimately, the questions of how much symmetry breaking can be tolerated and how to optimize its design must be addressed for all fusion concepts. A closely coupled program of simulation, experimental validation, and design optimization is required to determine what forms and amplitudes of 3D shaping and symmetry breaking will be compatible with the requirements of future fusion reactors.},

abstract = {While the basic equations of MHD spectral theory date back to 1958 for static plasmas (Bernstein et al 1958 Proc. R. Soc. A 244 17) and to 1960 for stationary plasma flows (Frieman and Rotenberg 1960 Rev. Mod. Phys. 32 898), progress on the latter subject has been slow since it suffers from lack of analytical insight concerning the structure of the spectrum. One of the reasons is the usual misnomer of 'non-self adjointness' of the stationary flow problem. Actually, self-adjointness of the occurring operators, namely the generalized force operator and the Doppler–Coriolis gradient operator −i$\rho$ v {\textperiodcentered}∇, was proved right away by Frieman and Rotenberg. Based on the reality of the two quadratic forms corresponding to these operators, we here construct (a) an effective method to compute the solution paths in the complex $\omega$ plane on which the eigenvalues are situated, (b) the counterpart of the oscillation theorem for eigenvalues of static equilibria (Goedbloed and Sakanaka 1974 Phys. Fluids 17 908) for the eigenvalues of stationary flows, based on the monotonicity of the alternating ratio, or alternator, of the boundary values of the displacement $\xi$ and the total pressure perturbation $\Pi$. This enables one to map out the complete spectrum of eigenvalues in the complex $\omega$-plane. The intricate topology of the solution paths is discussed for the fundamental examples of Rayleigh–Taylor, Kelvin–Helmholtz and combined instabilities.},

abstract = {The nonuniqueness of the poloidal angle $\theta$ in the parametric representation of a space curve x($\theta$) = [R($\theta$),Z($\theta$)] can be exploited to condense the Fourier spectra of R and Z. The nonlinear equation describing this spectral condensation was previously derived and solved numerically using Lagrange multipliers. Here a special case of the condensation equation is shown to be exactly solvable, leading to an explicit representation for x. A family of such representations is generated that possesses increasingly condensed spectra as a parameter is varied. Applications to a variety of curves are considered as models for three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria with nested flux surfaces. A substantial improvement occurs in spectral convergence compared with a polar representation, while retaining the numerical simplicity of the polar constraint. The asymptotic behavior for the R and Z spectral coefficients near a magnetic axis is analyzed. Implications for improvements of MHD equilibrium calculations are discussed.},

abstract = {This introductory course on the classical Boundary Element Method also contains advanced topics such as the Dual Reciprocity and the Hybrid Boundary Element Methods. The latter methods are extensions that permit the application of BME to anisotropic materials, as well as multi-field problems and fluid-structure interaction. The class-tested textbook offers a clear and easy-to-understand introduction to the subject, including worked-out examples that describe all the basic features of the method. The first two chapters not only establish the mathematical basis for BEM but also review the basics of continuum mechanics for field problems, perhaps a unique feature for a text on numerical methods. This helps the reader to understand the physical principles of the field problems, to apply the method judiciously, and toe critically evaluate the results.

abstract = {The paper presents the KINX code for computing linear ideal MHD growth rates and eigenvectors of axisymmetric plasmas surrounded by a vacuum layer and a conducting wall. Plasma equilibrium magnetic surfaces are assumed to be nested either in the whole plasma domain (separatrix at the plasma boundary is possible) or in the domains separated by an internal separatrix (doublet and divertor configurations). The computational domain is decomposed into subdomains with nested flux surfaces. In each subdomain finite hybrid elements are used on an equilibrium grid adapted to magnetic surfaces. Numerical destabilization is eliminated; this results in better convergence properties and makes possible efficient stability index calculation ($\delta$W-code). An inverse vector iteration method and a vectorizable matrix solver are applied to the matrix eigenvalue problem. The stability studies of external kink modes for doublet and single null configurations are given as application examples of the KINX code. Another version of the code, KINX-W, computing resistive wall n = 0 mode growth rates, is also presented for single null, doublet and divertor plasma configurations.},

This second-order differential equation with coefficients periodic in the independent variable $\theta$k is assumed to apply even in cases where simple WKB quantization conditions break down, thus providing an alternative to semiclassical quantization. Also, it provides a test bed for developing more advanced WKB methods, e.g. the apparent discontinuity between quantization formulae for ‘trapped' and ‘passing' modes, whose ray paths have different topologies, is removed by extending the WKB method to include the phenomena of tunnelling and reflection. The BSE is applied to instabilities with shear in the real part of the local frequency, so that the dispersion relation is inherently complex. As the frequency shear is increased, it is found that trapped modes go over to passing modes, reducing the maximum growth rate by averaging over $\theta$k.},

If such equilibria can be attained experimentally, they will be very attractive for decreasing the projected costs of tokamak power reactors. In the flux-conserving tokamak (FCT) model, where rapid heating is applied to an already relatively hot plasma, these high-$\beta$ equilibria are achievable. The quasi-static evolution of FCT equilibria as $\beta$ increases is studied. An operating window is found in the pressure profile width w p at the half-height: for high $\beta$, the values of w p lie between 0.40 and 0.55 times the minor plasma diameter. Within this window, plasma current and poloidal $\beta$ increase with $\beta$. For fixed plasma boundary, significant poloidal surface currents are induced, but these can be eliminated by small increases in the plasma minor radius, the pressure profile width, or the vacuum toroidal field.},

abstract = {The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability limits for the edge transport barrier (ETB) region in tokamaks are explored, concentrating in particular on the intermediate to high toroidal mode number, n, modes. These calculations take full account of the effect of the edge bootstrap current on the stability of both ballooning and peeling modes. Because the current plays an important role in MHD stability, the temperature and density independently influence stability and, in particular, the pressure gradient that the ETB can support. The stability calculations therefore provide limits to the achievable temperature pedestal associated with the transport barrier which are not simply pressure pedestal limits, as is often assumed. One important result is that increasing triangularity is predicted to be beneficial in providing access to a higher temperature pedestal at fixed pedestal width, at least up to triangularity similar to0.5. Another significant result is that the finite n corrections, which are stabilizing for ballooning modes, are important for narrow pedestal widths and permit significantly higher temperature pedestals than one would obtain using the leading order (n = infinity) ballooning theory. Specific calculations for equilibria characteristic of ITER and FIRE suggest that temperature pedestals in the region of a few kiloelectronvolts should be achievable, but the precise value depends on the pedestal width, a prediction for which is beyond the scope of this paper.},

The need for fast dense numerical linear algebra is hence of utmost significance. Most of the dense matrices arising out of applications can be efficiently represented by hierarchical matrices, which are data sparse representations of certain class of dense matrices.

The result is that coupled peeling–ballooning modes at intermediate n (3{\textless}n{\textless}20) are often the limiting instability which constrains the pedestal and triggers ELMs. These modes are characterized in shaped tokamak equilibria using an efficient new numerical code, and simplified models are developed for pedestal limits and the ELM cycle.

@article{Lang2013,
abstract = {Operating ITER in the reference inductive scenario at the design values of Ip = 15MA andQDT = 10 requires the achievement of good H-mode confinement that relies on the presence of an edge transport barrier whose pedestal pressure height is key to plasma performance. Strong gradients occur at the edge in such conditions that can drive magnetohydrodynamic instabilities resulting in edge localized modes (ELMs), which produce a rapid energy loss from the pedestal region to the plasma facing components (PFC). Without appropriate control, the heat loads on PFCs during ELMs in ITER are expected to become significant for operation in H-mode at Ip = 6–9MA; operation at higher plasma currents would result in a very reduced life time of the PFCs. Currently, several options are being considered for the achievement of the required level of ELM control in ITER; this includes operation in plasma regimes which naturally have no or very small ELMs, decreasing the ELM energy loss by increasing their frequency by a factor of up to 30 and avoidance of ELMs by actively controlling the edge with magnetic perturbations. Small/no ELM regimes obtained by influencing the edge stability (by plasma shaping, rotational shear control, etc) have shown in present experiments a significant reduction of the ELM heat fluxes compared to type-I ELMs. However, so far they have only been observed under a limited range of pedestal conditions depending on each specific device and their extrapolation to ITER remains uncertain. ELM control by increasing their frequency relies on the controlled triggering of the edge instability leading to the ELM. This has been presently demonstrated with the injection of pellets and with plasma verticalmovements; pellets having provided the results more promising for application in ITER conditions. ELM avoidance/suppression takes advantage of the fact that relatively small changes in the pedestal plasma and magnetic field parameters seem to have a large stabilizing effect on large ELMs. Application of edge magnetic field perturbation with non-axisymmetric fields is found to affect transport at the plasma edge and thus prevent the uncontrolled rise of the plasma pressure gradients and the occurrence of type-I ELMs. This paper compiles a brief overview of various ELM control approaches, summarizes their present achievements and briefly discusses the open issues regarding their application in ITER.},

The nonlinear response can be treated as a dynamic stability problem or from a nearby perturbed equilibrium approach. The nearby equilibrium approach aims to bypass the detailed evolution and search for the appropriate final state. For these nonlinear models, there is no guarantee that the final state is the one chosen dynamically by the plasma among possible multiple states, or is even accessible. To assure accessibility of the final state, one needs to relate the two-dimensional and nearby three-dimensional system through some set of invariants. One implementation is to add a perturbation from an external field or obtained from a stability code to the equilibrium and solve for 3D force balance. In that case, the invariants are buried in the numerical details of the equilibrium code. An appropriate set of constraints is not presently known; they depend on whether the dynamic evolution should be considered adiabatic or not. It is proposed that a suitable set of invariants may be obtained from considering the magnetic helicity, which is conserved exactly in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) but is broken at rational surfaces by non-ideal effects. In general, constraints for the equilibrium approach, including magnetic helicity, can be validated using full nonlinear extended MHD calculations in the dynamic approach.},

abstract = {The JET scrape-off layer (SOL) has been characterized with a reciprocating probe in inner wall (IW), and outer wall (OW), limited plasmas. Experiments revealed that SOL profiles are substantially broader (by a factor of ∼5–7.5 in the power e-folding length) for IW limited than in OW limited plasmas. Results are consistent with the larger radial turbulent transport found for IW limited plasmas. Major differences are observed between IW and OW limited plasmas on the density and electron temperature e-folding lengths, parallel flow, radial turbulent transport as well as on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the fluctuations. Experimental findings on JET suggest that the differences in the SOL characteristics for both configurations are due to a combination of a poloidal asymmetry in radial transport with a reduced cross-field transport across the last closed flux surface associated with the confinement improvement observed for OW limited plasmas. The dependence of the SOL power e-folding length on the main plasma parameters was also investigated for IW limited plasmas and a modest negative dependence on both the plasma current and the line-averaged density found. Finally, it is shown that the SOL radial transport and the amplitude of the fluctuations increase with plasma current and decrease with line-averaged density for IW limited plasmas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society.Rapid bifurcations in the plasma response to slowly varying n=2 magnetic fields are observed as the plasma transitions into and out of edge-localized mode (ELM) suppression. The rapid transition to ELM suppression is characterized by an increase in the toroidal rotation and a reduction in the electron pressure gradient at the top of the pedestal that reduces the perpendicular electron flow there to near zero. These events occur simultaneously with an increase in the inner-wall magnetic response. These observations are consistent with strong resonant field penetration of n=2 fields at the onset of ELM suppression, based on extended MHD simulations using measured plasma profiles. Spontaneous transitions into (and out of) ELM suppression with a static applied n=2 field indicate competing mechanisms of screening and penetration of resonant fields near threshold conditions. Magnetic measurements reveal evidence for the unlocking and rotation of tearinglike structures as the plasma transitions out of ELM suppression.},

abstract = {A non-linear MHD code, named JOREK, is under development with the aim of studying the non-linear evolution of the MHD instabilities thought to be responsible for edge localized modes (ELMs): external kink (peeling) and medium- n ballooning modes. The full toroidal X-point geometry is taken into account including the separatrix, open and closed field lines. Analysis of the influence of the separatrix shows a strong stabilization of the ideal and resistive MHD external kink/peeling modes. One instability remains unstable in the presence of the X-point, characterized by a combination of a tearing and a peeling mode. The so-called peeling–tearing mode shows a much weaker dependence on the edge q . Non-linearly the n = 1 peeling–tearing mode saturates at a constant amplitude yielding a mostly kink-like perturbation of the boundary with an island-like structure close to the X-point. The non-linear evolution of a medium- n ballooning mode shows the formation of density filaments. The density filaments are sheared off from the main plasma by an n = 0 flow non-linearly induced by the Maxwell stress. The amplitude of the ballooning mode is limited by this n = 0 flow and multiple (in time) density filaments can develop to bring the plasma below the stability boundary.},

The application of a rotating RMP field causes the strike point splitting to rotate, distributing the particle and heat flux evenly over the divertor. The RMP coils in MAST have been used to generate a rotating perturbation with a toroidal mode number n = 3. The ELM frequency is doubled with the application of the RMP rotating field, whilst maintaining the H mode. During mitigation, the ELM peak heat flux is seen to be reduced by 50{\%} for a halving in the ELM energy and motion of the strike point, consistent with the rotation of the applied RMP field, is seen using high spatial resolution (1.5 mm at the target) heat flux profiles measured using infrared (IR) thermography.},

abstract = {A WKB formalism for constructing normal modes of short‐wavelength ideal hydromagnetic, pressure‐driven instabilities (ballooning modes) in general toroidal magnetic containment devices with sheared magnetic fields is developed. No incompressibility approximation is made. A dispersion relation is obtained from the eigenvalues of a fourth‐order system of ordinary differential equations to be solved by integrating along a line of force. Higher‐order calculations are performed to find the amplitude equation and the phase change at a caustic. These conform to typical WKB results. In axisymmetric systems, the ray equations are integrable, and semiclassical quantization leads to a growth rate spectrum consisting of an infinity of discrete eigenvalues, bounded above by an accumulation point. However, each eigenvalue is infinitely degenerate. In the nonaxisymmetric case, the rays are unbounded in a four‐dimensional phase space, and semiclassical quantization breaks down, leading to broadening of the discrete eigenvalues and the accumulation point of the axisymmetric unstable spectrum into continuum bands. Analysis of a model problem indicates that the broadening of the discrete eigenvalues is numerically very small, the dominant effect being broadening of the accumulation point.},

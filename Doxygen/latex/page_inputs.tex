This page describes the various input variables that PB3D and POST can take.

Inputs are generally done through the input file, but there are some inputs that are provided on runtime, using the command-\/line with {\ttfamily --\+[option\+\_\+name]\+} format. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
See init\+\_\+files().
\end{DoxySeeAlso}
For both PB3D and POST, both types are discussed.

Some general remarks:\+
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There is some fault detection built into the routines. These distinguish between minor faults, that trigger a warning but do not stop execution, and major faults, that trigger an error that stop execution. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
See writo().
\end{DoxySeeAlso}

\item The data type {\ttfamily real} refers to double precision real, defined by \doxylink{namespacenum__vars_a03802aa2bd86439d7a9370836fabf3f2}{num\+\_\+vars.\+dp}. For integers, standard precision is used.
\item There are hard-\/coded {\ttfamily min\+\_\+tol} and {\ttfamily max\+\_\+tol} in read\+\_\+input\+\_\+opts(), which are used to limit the tolerances {\ttfamily tol\+\_\+rich}, {\ttfamily tol\+\_\+zero} and {\ttfamily tol\+\_\+\+SLEPC}. This could be changed if needed.
\item If {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+style = 2} (i.\+e. HELENA), the total maximum memory available must be enough to perform the first Richardson level in a single equilibrium job (see \doxysectlink{page_overview}{General code structure}{0}).

If {\ttfamily min\+\_\+sec\+\_\+X} and {\ttfamily max\+\_\+sec\+\_\+X} is set, the user prescribes the secondary mode number range ({\ttfamily X\+\_\+style} = 1). If {\ttfamily n\+\_\+mod\+\_\+X} is set, on the other hand, the user prescribes the size of the range, which is automatically chosen ({\ttfamily X\+\_\+style} = 2). They cannot be both chosen.

This needs to be between 1 and the maximum level that was obtained in a previous solution, plus 1. For technical HDF5 reasons, if Richardson restart is used, the same input fil parameters should be used for {\ttfamily max\+\_\+tot\+\_\+mem} and the same number of processes should be used.

For the case of \doxylink{interfacenum__ops_1_1calc__zero__hh}{num\+\_\+ops.\+calc\+\_\+zero\+\_\+hh()}, at every iteration it is checked whether the correction approximation is better than the original one.

For {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+style = 1}, the equilibrium is axisymmetric, so by default {\ttfamily n\+\_\+theta\+\_\+plot = 501} and {\ttfamily n\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot = 1}; for {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+style = 2}, the equilibrium can be 3-\/D, so {\ttfamily n\+\_\+theta\+\_\+plot = 201} and {\ttfamily n\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot = 51}

For {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+style = 1}, the equilibrium is axisymmetric, so by default {\ttfamily min\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot = max\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot 0}; for {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+style = 2}, the equilibrium can be 3-\/D, so {\ttfamily min\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot = 0} and {\ttfamily max\+\_\+zeta\+\_\+plot = 2}.

This refers to the external plots, which are complimentary to the HDF5 plots. See draw\+\_\+ex().

If output is done that requires a solution, this needs to be between 1 and the maximum level that was obtained in PB3D. See find\+\_\+max\+\_\+rich\+\_\+lvl(). If no solution is found, some of the outputs that do not depend on this still work.\+Optionally, this can be forced by choosing {\ttfamily PB3\+D\+\_\+rich\+\_\+lvl} not positive.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni23}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni23}%
The {\ttfamily POST\+\_\+style} determines whether the post-\/processing is done on an extended, new grid, or on the PB3D internal grid. On top of this, through {\ttfamily plot\+\_\+grid\+\_\+style} the user can set the output grid for the post-\/processing. Note that some combinations of styles do not make sense.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni24}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni24}%
By default, the plot normal range is chosen equal to the solution normal range from {\ttfamily min\+\_\+r\+\_\+sol} and {\ttfamily max\+\_\+r\+\_\+sol}, but it can be restricted. This is useful, for example, to reduce computation time.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni25}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni25}%
The Cartesian components of the result of the division of {\ttfamily pert\+\_\+mult\+\_\+factor\+\_\+\+POST} by the maximum value of the solution normal mode amplitude is added to the equilibrium Cartesian grid components to illustrate the perturbation in 3-\/D. This is done for each solution independently and sequentially. If it is not positive, it is ignored. Note that {\ttfamily plot\+\_\+sol\+\_\+xi = .true.} is necessary for this to be used.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni26}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni26}%
These quantities are calculated in \doxylink{interfacesol__utilities_1_1calc__xuq}{sol\+\_\+utilities.\+calc\+\_\+xuq()}. This is done for a time sequene, currently hard-\/coded in plot\+\_\+sol\+\_\+vec(), depending on whether the solution is stable or unstable.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni27}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni27}%
The energy reconstruction is performed in calc\+\_\+e() if either one of {\ttfamily plot\+\_\+sol\+\_\+xi}, {\ttfamily plot\+\_\+sol\+\_\+Q} or {\ttfamily plot\+\_\+\+E\+\_\+rec} is true.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni28}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni28}%
Equivalent use is through {\ttfamily -\/t}. If this is used, {\ttfamily do\+\_\+execute\+\_\+command\+\_\+line} should be set to true as well. See generic\+\_\+tests().
\item \label{page_inputs_fni29}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni29}%
This is used internally as well, to suppress certain output. See run\+\_\+driver\+\_\+x() and run\+\_\+driver\+\_\+post().

\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni30}%
This can fail on local systems, and generally works badly on computational clusters, where the computational nodes often don\textquotesingle{}t have the external tools (see {\ttfamily ex\+\_\+plot\+\_\+style}) installed. By default, an output file is created for the shell commands, which can be executed afterwards. See \doxysectlink{page_outputs_output_file_shell}{Shell commands file}{2}.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni31}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni31}%
This is done by calling get\+\_\+mem\+\_\+usage() and storing the result at every allocation and deallocation of an {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+1\+\_\+type}, {\ttfamily eq\+\_\+2\+\_\+type}, {\ttfamily X\+\_\+1\+\_\+type}, {\ttfamily X\+\_\+2\+\_\+type}, {\ttfamily vac\+\_\+type} or {\ttfamily sol\+\_\+type}, as well as for input quantities. Furthermore at every user output with writo(), this is also done, and the output is prepended to the output string. Also, the output is written to a file. See \doxysectlink{page_outputs_output_file_mem}{Memory usage file}{2}.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni32}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni32}%
This is useful to calculate the ripple in these quantities. To use this, it is necessary to have an output grid of only 3 points, where the poloidal projection of the middle point should be the in the middle between the poloidal projections of the two others. Also, you have to provide through {\ttfamily RZ\+\_\+0} the $R$ and $Z$ value of the origin of the geometrical poloidal angle that is used to calculate distances. See \doxylink{interfacegrid__utilities_1_1calc__tor__diff}{grid\+\_\+utilities.\+calc\+\_\+tor\+\_\+diff()}.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni33}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni33}%
Jumping straight to the solution is useful if a simulation already calculated all the necessary quantities to set up the solution matrices $\overline{\text{A}}$ and $\overline{\text{B}}$ in $\overline{\text{A}} \vec{X} = \lambda \overline{\text{B}} \vec{X}$ and the solution needs to be redone, for example because a calculation was attempted with a method that did not converge.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni34}%

This is a rather complicated procedure with many possibilities that is intended for expert use. See create\+\_\+vmec\+\_\+input().

Using the toroidal flux is {\bfseries{experimental}} and {\bfseries{untested}}.
\item \label{page_inputs_fni36}%
\Hypertarget{page_inputs_fni36}%
Have a look in calc\+\_\+norm\+\_\+range(). {\ttfamily X\+\_\+grid\+\_\+style} $1$ is generally too coarse while {\ttfamily X\+\_\+grid\+\_\+style} $2$ is too fine. {\ttfamily X\+\_\+grid\+\_\+style} $3$ was designed to have the both of best world. It only makes sense for {\ttfamily X\+\_\+style} 2 (fast), though, as in the enrichment process the fast secondary mode range is used to limit the maximum amount the quantity $n q$ (when using poloidal flux) or $m \iota$ (when using toroidal flux) to {\ttfamily max\+\_\+njq\+\_\+change} between two normal grid points.
